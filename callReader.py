doc = '''Veteran lawyer Ram Boolchand Jethmalani passed away on Sunday at the age of 95, leaving behind a huge void in India's legal circle. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "India has not only lost an exceptional lawyer but also an iconic personality. "Over the span of his career, Jethmalani had a strong impact on the judiciary of the country and appeared in many high-profile cases, some of which are still referred for teaching tricks of the trade to budding law students. Known for his contributions in the field of law, Jethmalani came in the spotlight after he got involved with the Nanavati murder case, which was one of the last cases to be heard by a jury in India. It was subsequently abolished in 1959. He became one of the highest-paid lawyers in India due to his ability to turn around the hardest of cases and defended many high-profile personalities including politicians and gangsters throughout his career. The legal genius. Jethmalani was a bright student from a very young age and started off practicing law early in his career after obtaining a law degree at the age of just 17. While he started off practicing in Sindh province till partition, he fled to India a year later and came to India with just a one paisa coin in his pocket. Though Jethmalani had no direct involvement in the high-profile Nanavati case, he assisted the public prosecutor CM Trivedi in framing arguments in the trial court and later in the high court. Later, his job was to assist YV Chandrachud, the public pleader in High Court. Jethmalani later said that the case earned him fame, which he said was the most important milestone of his career. After the case, he was credited for presenting a unique style of theatrical cross-examination. The case became prominent as it involved a decorated Navy officer KM Nanavati, who killed his wife's lover Prem Ahuja. However, the media trial in the case ensured that Nanavati got massive support from the Parsi community. However, the jury verdict in the case in favour of Nanavati was overruled and legislation was passed subsequently to abolish jury trials in the country. During the late 1960s, Jethmalani also earned the moniker, smugglers' lawyer, as he defended a string of smugglers at the time. When he faced criticism for defending criminals including Haji Mastan, Jethmalani used to calmly respond that he was just doing his duty as a lawyer. Among the high-profile cases under his belt, he defended Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parekh in the Securities Scam case 1992. Jethmalani also defended senior BJP leader LK Advani in the Hawala scam. Jethmalani served as senior counsel for Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, who were convicted for the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. While he managed to secure a stay order on their execution orders, the duo was hanged to death a year later. The veteran lawyer had argued on behalf of V Sriharan in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case and told the Supreme Court on July 2015 that the suicide bomb attack that killed the former prime minister was "not a crime against India". Jethmalani also garnered attention for defending Manu Sharma, who was the prime accused in the Jessica Lall murder case. Sharma, the son of senior Congress leader Vinod Sharma, was convicted for murdering the model in 1999. He later represented DMK leader Kanimozhi in the infamous 2G scam case, which finally led to the downfall of the UPA government. Besides, Jethmalani had also defended self-styled godman Asaram Bapu in a sexual assault case and late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case. Not to forget, the veteran lawyer had defended Union Home Minister Amit Shah in several fake encounter cases including the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case. The political rebel. While his political career does not match his contributions as a lawyer, Jethmalani had played a leading role during the emergency period from 1975 to 1977. He was critical of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi and his sharp commentary against the government earned him an arrest warrant during the time. However, it was stayed by the Bombay High Court after he received massive support from the law community. At the time, Jethmalani was the chairman of the Bar Association of India. When the stay was nullified, Jethmalani went to Canada and campaigned against emergency; he returned almost 10 months later when the emergency was lifted. Soon after, he ousted the then serving Union law minister HR Gokhale from Mumbai in the Lok Sabha and started his political career as a parliamentarian. He became a member of the Rajya Sabha in 1988 and later went on to assume the role of Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs in 1996 as part of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. During the second tenure of the Vajpayee government in 1998, Jethmalani was given the portfolio of Union Minister of Urban Affairs and Employment. However, in 1999, he was again sworn in as the Union law minister. According to reports, Jethmalani was only inducted in the cabinet on the insistence of the then home minister LK Advani and he had never been on good terms with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It became clear when Jethmalani contested against Vajpayee from the Lucknow constituency as an independent candidate in 2004. Jethmalani, who has been known for his straight-forward nature, never hesitated from pointing out issues, even if it discredited his own party. In 2012, Jethmalani wrote to the then BJP president Nitin Gadkari, alleging opposition BJP leaders of being silent against huge corruption by members of the UPA-II government. When Jethmalani's letter became public on the internet, BJP expelled him on May 2013 for six years for making "anti-party" statements. While his political career does not comprise his fondest memories, his contributions in the field of criminal law helped redefine the legal system of the country. During his lifetime, Jethmalani also won several awards including the International Jurist Award, World Peace Through Law Award and the Human Rights Award for his fight against authoritarianism at the Philippines.'''
